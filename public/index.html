	"Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes, and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat the dark, who only stand and breathe."
